## Introduction
This repository contains the code for the multi-omics and spatial single cell investigation of IDH-mutant astrocytoma. We analyzed MS-based Proteomics, bulk DNA sequencing, RNA sequencing, DNA methylation array, whole side imaging and single cell RNA-seq data, as well as 10x Visium HD spatial transcriptomics and CODEX multiplex imaging data. The data were used for protein-based clustering, survival analysis, multi-omics characterization, cell type annotation, and spatial analysis. We also developed an AI-aided multiomics  classifier based on multi-omics features. 


Code for these analysis were included in each corresponding folder. A small dataset is also provided to demo the code.
